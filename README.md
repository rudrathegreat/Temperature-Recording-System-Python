The Temperature Recording System

Ever want a system where you can know the temperature and that the predictions are s accurate as they can be? Introducing, the temperature recording system.

The system allows you to find out the temperature at a particular location. It will then process this data onto Scratch for a visual display of the temperature.

This may be useful for forecasters if they want to find patterns in the temperature so they can use the system and the visual display on Scratch to see those patterns very easily.
